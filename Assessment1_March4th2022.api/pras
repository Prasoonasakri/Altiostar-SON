# Question Title :Crypto

## Problem description:

An Altiostar employee wanted to send a message to his friend in a group chat but he doesn't want
other employees to know what the message is. so he decided to encrypt his message and send
it in the group chat. as you who is a friend of him know how to decrypt it as you know how it is 
encrypted.

An Altiostar employee decided to change all the common letters used in English language to some symbols
so that reading it when it's encrypted doesn't give any meaning to other employees.But you as his
friend knows how to decrypt it.

The encryption is as follows:

e -> !\
t -> @ \
a -> #\
i -> $ \
o -> % \
n -> ^ \
s -> &\
h -> *\
r -> (

So you as his friend need to write a function to decrypt the message sent to you by him.

## Input constraints:
All the letters in the message will be lowercase and maximum length will not exceed 2^32 -1

## Input format:
Encrpted string str.

## output format:
manipulate the string(as its a pass by reference to function) str so that it's encrypted.

## sample input:

1) gururaj
2) batman
3) ilovecandy

## sample output:

1) gu(u(#j
2) b#)m#^
3) $l%v!c#^dy
