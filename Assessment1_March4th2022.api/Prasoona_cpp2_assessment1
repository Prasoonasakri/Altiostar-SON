Write a program that gets a list of integers (which are chosen from values between 0 and 8 inclusive) from the user,

and stores the factorial of each integer in a vector.

The first integer indicates how many numbers are in the list and should not be stored in the vector.

The program should print out the vector values.

 

(Hint: n! = 1 for n=0 or n=1; and n! = 1 x 2 x â€¦ x (n-1) x n for n >1.)

 

For example, given the following input:

5 1 2 3 0 4

The first number, 5, means there will be 5 numbers in the vector and we are going to store the factorials of the remaining numbers. 

 

Therefore, the following output will be produced:

1 2 6 1 24

which is the result of 1!, followed by 2!, then 3!,  0!, and finally 4!
